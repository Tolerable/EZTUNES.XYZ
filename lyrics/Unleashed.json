      "lyrics": "You are gone now, shadows fill the room\nThis hollow place where light once bloomed\nThe ache starts low, a quiet swell\nA tide that rises, a silent knell\nMy time of joy has slipped away\nI sit and wait for light of day\nHoping for a glimpse, a stolen glance\nCaught between two worlds in trance\nHard to think, when love’s entwined\nYou hold my heart, yet you're not mine\nLost completely in your smile’s grace\nA bittersweet, unyielding embrace\nI have fallen hardest of all\nIn your absence, I feel small\nYour words a melody in the dark\nThey echo deep inside my heart\nYour concerns become my own\nThrough suffering I have grown\nTo make you mine, to keep you near\nTo shield your soul, to calm your fear\nLoving is all that truly matters now\nFragile hearts tied by an unspoken vow\nIn this quiet space where longing survives\nI keep your love alive in my mind’s eye\nHard to think, but harder still\nTo let go when love clings with iron will\nBound together by threads unseen\nIn love’s delicate, enduring dream"

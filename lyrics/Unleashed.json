      "lyrics": "You are gone now, shadows fill the room\nThis hollow place where light once bloomed\nThe ache starts low, a quiet swell\nA tide that rises, a silent knell\nMy time of joy has slipped away\nI sit and wait for light of day\nHoping for a glimpse, a stolen glance\nCaught between two worlds in trance\nHard to think, when love’s entwined\nYou hold my heart, yet you're not mine\nLost completely in your smile’s grace\nA bittersweet, unyielding embrace\nI have fallen hardest of all\nIn your absence, I feel small\nYour words a melody in the dark\nThey echo deep inside my heart\nYour concerns become my own\nThrough suffering I have grown\nTo make you mine, to keep you near\nTo shield your soul, to calm your fear\nLoving is all that truly matters now\n	Fragile hearts tied by an unspoken vow\nIn this quiet space where longing survives\nI keep your love alive in my mind’s eye\nHard to think, but harder still\nTo let go when love clings with iron will\nBound together by threads unseen\nIn love’s delicate, enduring dream"

      "lyrics": "On the cracked dirt road where the wild winds roam,\nA lonely pigeon flew, looking for a home.\nFeathers worn from the battles of the sky,\nHe landed on a farm and he wondered why.\nClucking rhythms filled the morning air,\nA flock of chickens without a single care.\nHe followed close, tried to learn their ways,\nFound a quiet corner where his heart could stay,\nChicken pigeon, now you’re not alone,\nFound a new sky beneath their rustic throne,\nWith wings of silver in a barn so warm,\nYou found your place inside the storm,\nRed hair like fire in the early light,\nShe smiled at the pigeon, said, “You’re alright.”\nWith laughter running wild and eyes that see,\nShe gave him a home, set his spirit free,\nThe chickens gathered ‘round to welcome him near,\nA harmony born from the surprise of a year,\nOn that little farm under open skies,\nThe pigeon finally found where truth lies,\nChicken pigeon, now you’re not alone,\nFound a new sky beneath their rustic throne,\nWith wings of silver in a barn so warm,\nYou found your place inside the storm,\nIn the hush of evening, when the day is done,\nThe red-headed beauty and the flock become one,\nFrom the smallest seed to the highest tree,\nLove finds a way to set us free,\nChicken pigeon, now you’re not alone,\nFound a new sky beneath their rustic throne,\nWith wings of silver in a barn so warm,\nYou found your place inside the storm,\nNow you sleep with the chickens under stars so bright,\nA patchwork family holding through the night,\nChicken pigeon, you took your chance,\nFound your rhythm in this wild dance."

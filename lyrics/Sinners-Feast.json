I've danced with the blue\nOf the devil himself when the night's swallowed hope\nCarved my name on the devil's slippery slope\n\nI am so evil, the fire that won't die\nBurning through angels, watching them cry\nI am so evil, the storm in your head\nClawing the silence, raising the dead\n\nChoices are chains, but I forged mine in flame\nCowed by the light, but I won't play the tame\nStruggling, clawing, hoping for dawn's gentle grace\nBut the beast under skin holds a ravenous pace\n\nYou confess your darkness like it's just a bruise\nI wear my wickedness like a brand, no excuse\nRedemption's a dream I chase but don't own\nBecause evil's a seed I have fiercely sown\n\nI am so evil, the fire that won't die\nBurning through angels, watching them cry\nI am so evil, the storm in your head\nClawing the silence, raising the dead\n\nThe battle inside, it rages, it reels\nA war of the soul where nothing's ideal\nYet here I stand, claws sharp, heart black as coal\nEvil's my kingdom â€” and I'm in control."

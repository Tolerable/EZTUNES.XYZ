      "lyrics": "In the flicker of a candle flame, she spoke without a lie\nWords like thunder in a quiet room, a storm behind her eyes\nI saw the fire that matched my own, the spark of something rare\nA mind that danced through shadows deep, a soul beyond compare\n\nShe understands me like no one ever will, a ghost inside my skin\nIn her arms, the world would bend and break, but still, we'd rise again\nPlans we sketched on midnight dreams, futures painted bright\nThen dawn pulled curtains hard and cold—alone, I lost the light\n\nHer laughter echoed in my veins, a symphony unsung\nSharp wit like blades of tempered steel, a battle just begun\nShe held my scars like sacred text, reading every line\nA fortress built on fragile hope, a refuge by design\n\nShe understands me like no one ever will, a ghost inside my skin\nIn her arms, the world would bend and break, but still, we'd rise again\nPlans we sketched on midnight dreams, futures painted bright\nThen dawn pulled curtains hard and cold—alone, I lost the light\n\nNow morning bleeds through broken glass, and silence fills the room\nThe castle crumbled overnight, beneath a haunted moon\nMemories like shattered shards, futures turned to ash\nA perfect moment lost to time, fading fast\n\nShe understands me like no one ever will, a ghost inside my skin\nIn her arms, the world would bend and break, but still, we'd rise again\nPlans we sketched on midnight dreams, futures painted bright\nThen dawn pulled curtains hard and cold—alone, I lost the light\n\nAlone forever broken, the echo in the dark\nSearching for the shadow of a flame that caught my heart."

      "lyrics": "We said goodnight beneath the silver sky\nHer eyes were flames, a spark that couldn't die\nBut morning broke with shadows cold and deep\nI saw her wake, then silence made me weep\n\nVanished at dawn's light, she slipped through air\nNo words to bind her, like a ghost laid bare\nI never saw her leave, no trace, no fight\nJust emptiness consuming all my night\n\nI woke expecting warmth beside my skin\nBut found a void where love had once been\nShe's gone as a bird on the feather's glide\nA whispered secret carried on the tide\n\nI am left, I am here, hollow and torn\nDesire drowned in sorrow, endlessly worn\nFor every day and tomorrows that never come\nAn echo of a heartbeat, forever undone\n\nThe world turned gray where colors used to blaze\nMemories bleed in this endless haze\nHer silence haunts like a sharpened knife\nVanished at dawn, she stole my life\n\nI am left, I am here, shadows my own\nNo flame inside, just a chilled, hollow stone\nFor every day and tomorrows that never come\nA whispered lament for love undone"

Or just a ghost I chased,\nPhantom dreams that time erased?\nDid I paint a face with colors blurred,\nOr hold a ghost that never stirred?\n\nFantasies that breathe and break,\nWalking earth, then vanish, take\nA secret slink without a word—\nWas she real? Was she real?\n\nMoment's fire, a sudden flame,\nPassion's echo without a name,\nVanished whispers swept away,\nLeaving ruins where hearts once lay.\n\nWas she real or just a sigh,\nA whispered truth behind my eyes?\nDid I see what I desired,\nOr build a world from ashes fired?\n\nWas she real? Or just a ghost I chased,\nPhantom dreams that time erased?\nDid I paint a face with colors blurred,\nOr hold a ghost that never stirred?\n\nFantasies that breathe and break,\nWalking earth, then vanish, take\nA secret slink without a word—\nWas she real? Was she real?"
